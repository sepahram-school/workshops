🚀 **Hands-On RisingWave Streaming Pipeline – Full Implementation!**

---

🎓 **This workshop is part of the Apache Kafka course at Sepahram Data Engineering School**

In this video, we demonstrate a **complete end-to-end streaming pipeline** using **RisingWave**, a SQL-based streaming database that allows you to manage real-time data flows **without writing a single line of code**.

💡 **What is RisingWave?**
RisingWave is a **streaming SQL engine** designed to handle real-time data ingestion, enrichment, and analytics. It integrates seamlessly with messaging systems like **Kafka/Redpanda** and supports:

- **CDC from relational databases** (PostgreSQL) for reference tables
- **Stream joins** and enrichment of transactional data
- **Materialized Views** for real-time analytics
- **Push-based subscriptions** for downstream services
- **Storage of processed outputs** in **RustFS** and **ClickHouse** in **Parquet format**

⚙️ **Pipeline Components Demonstrated in This Video:**

- Setup and launch of **RisingWave**
- Streaming transactional data from **Redpanda**
- Joining and enriching data with **PostgreSQL reference tables**
- Persisting results in **RustFS** and **ClickHouse** as **Parquet files**
- Connecting to RisingWave using **DBeaver, PSQL, and RisingWave Console**

📊 **Key Use Cases Shown:**

- Enriching transaction streams with metadata
- Real-time aggregation and analytics via **Materialized Views**
- Handling stream-stream joins for net transaction calculations
- Windowed aggregations for detecting patterns or anomalies
- Subscriptions to push real-time updates to downstream applications

🎯 By the end of this video, you will see **a fully working streaming data pipeline**, from ingestion to processing, enrichment, and storage – **all managed through SQL with minimal effort**.
